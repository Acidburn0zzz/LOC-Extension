Some ideas for improvements/things todo:

1. Cache results to improve performance and reduce the likelihood of 
   hitting the Poloniex 6 calls per second limit. A call to returnTicker
   gets the prices for everything on the exchange so only 1 API call 
   should be needed to get the prices for anything on the sheet. But
   where to cache the results? What is the lifetime of the python 
   session which services the request?

2. Switch to using ccxt (https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.git). This much 
   more comprehensive wrapper talks to 77+ exchanges.

3. Package whichever API wrapper is used with the extension to make 
   installation easier. Currently it's a mess! But then "we" have to 
   maintain the wrapper too.

4. After #3, submit extension to https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions
